# üõí E-Commerce Microservices Project
### Built with Spring Boot 3, Spring Cloud, Kafka and Docker

---

## üìñ Overview

This project is a **microservices-based e-commerce application** built using **Spring Boot 3.  
It demonstrates a full distributed architecture with inter-service communication, asynchronous messaging, centralized configuration, and distributed tracing.

The system is composed of multiple independent microservices communicating through REST APIs and Kafka.  
Each service is containerized using Docker, and the infrastructure includes databases, message brokers, and monitoring tools.
